- Follow up exercise, posts to read and discussion about the topics

## What there is in the end?

In the end is expected for the mentored to have developed:
- Raw Ingestion
- ETL
- Airflow Scripts 
- Design end tables on bigquery

### Plus

For more advanced ones:
- Real time with Scio and DataFlow
